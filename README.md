Neverglade is a calming, low-contrast colour scheme for focused work. It contains 22 colours coming in 3 flavours â€” Ebony, Oak, and Birch. 

Originally based on [Everforest](https://github.com/sainnhe/everforest), it aims to become community-driven but in its current state it is largely a personal project of [Emma Alexandria](https://github.com/emmalexandria).
